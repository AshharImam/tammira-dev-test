# Tammira Dev Test

This project includes features required for the developer test.
1. Blog CRUD
2. User Registration and Login flow
3. Search with Tags
4. Search with keywords
5. User Edit profile with Picture upload


I did not write the code in Typescript because it was not specifically mentioned in the document.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AshharImam/tammira-dev-test.git

2. Install dependencies in both folders i.e app, backend:
    ```bash
    yarn add
